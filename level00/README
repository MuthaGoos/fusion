Target:  binary running on fusion connected to port 20000

Shellcode: bindshell that opens port to 1337

To win: execute ./pwnlevel00 and nc <ip> 1337 to get shell

What I learned:
   - wrote execve shell code from scrath
   - write bindshell code from scratch
      - make sure that all arguments for a syscall are satisfied
      - clean old registers if they were used previously and the syscall requires them
   - need a better way to move opcodes into pwn script
      - wasted a lot of time with copy errors
