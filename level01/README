What I learned:
    - forgot that my shell code opens up a port listening on 1337 that will give you shell
    - mnemonic retn imm16 will pop that many bytes off stack
    - can use overflow bytes as means to execute code as well
    - be careful when trampolining, be sure to execute bind shell code from the beginning and not hop into it accidentally!



How to win:

    python pwnlevel01.sh > exploit

On another terminal
    nc 192.168.56.37 1337
